# Assignments Repository

## Purpose

This repository is where all text files will be submitted for this course. For much of this course we will use a mixture of text files with written answers and submitted YAML to demonstrate progress on assignment.

## Directions

After cloning this repository, create a directory with your name, using [kebab-case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Special_case_styles), e.g. if your name is `Andreas Kavountzis`, your directory will be `andreas-kavountzis`. Be careful to make sure your directory name does not contain spaces.

**Note:** All of your work goes in your named directory.

## FAQ

- Is having a single repository for all students' work problematic?

  No. All of your work will occur in your named folder, so you should not have conflicts with your classmates' work. Additionally, this will get you in the habit of `git pull` / `git push` as a normal part of everyday work.
